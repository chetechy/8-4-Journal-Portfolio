# How do I approach designing software?
Becuas eof the complexoity of this project I did a lot of research and watching videos. Also I asked my peers for assistance on concepts and logic that struggled with grasping. As I got different parts of the code completded I ran the debug to make sure there were no erros, if there were I worked out each error on build at a time.
  
# How do I approach developing programs?
To make my project more organized, I decided to break the program up into smaller modules and have each one of those modules’ kind of independent of the others in that they don’t really know what each one is doing they all just kind of work together. Basically, you're sending information from one module to the next and the module that receives the information will do something with that information but it's kind of unknown about the rest of the program. The rest of the program doesn't really know what that module's doing and vice versa. It's kind of up to the user to help them talk to one another.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I can see these skills being very useful for me in the future no matter what I end up in professionally. Not only did I learn a lot about 2D and 3D graphics, but digging deeper into libraries and directories and setting up projects for something like OpenGL really expanded my understanding of project configurations. I also learned how to debug and fix errors since I was getting a lot of these in the beginning.
